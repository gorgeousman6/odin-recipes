        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These copycat Hostess cupcakes are a treat for all chocolate lovers: chocolate cupcakes filled 
           with cream and topped with chocolate frosting and that signature white icing finish.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Cupcakes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups flour</li>
            <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>¼ cup shortening</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Frosting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup chocolate frosting</li>
            <li>¾ cup vanilla frosting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 36 muffin cups with paper cups.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, white sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, oil, water, and vanilla extract. Mix with an electric mixer 
                at low speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Fill prepared muffin cups a little over half full (use a #20 or 3-tablespoon scoop).

            </li>
            <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, 18 to 22 minutes. Transfer from pans to wire racks to cool completely.

            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, for the filling, combine powdered sugar, butter, shortening, milk, vanilla extract, and a pinch salt in another large bowl. Using clean beaters, mix with an electric mixer at high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Insert a large round tip into a pastry bag; fill with filling. Push tip through top of each cooled cupcake to fill; wipe excess frosting off to create a smooth top.</li>
            <li>Frost tops with chocolate frosting. Insert a small round tip into a clean pastry bag; fill with vanilla frosting. Pipe frosting across tops of cupcakes in loops. Transfer cupcakes to an airtight container. Store at room temperature up to 3 days or freeze up to 3 months.</li>
        </ol>
